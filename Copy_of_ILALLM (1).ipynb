              "\" \\n Anti-Dowry Law in India  \\nDowry or dahej is a gift taken by the groom or his family from the bride's family. The anti  \\ndowry law in India makes taking dowry illegal. However, there is a need to change it due to  \\nthe increasing misuse of anti-dowry law.  \\nIn the past few years, the Indian criminal laws have experienced tremendous amendments.  \\nThe Indian laws are diligently amended to protect the interest of women in India and  \\nprovide them safety against any illegal or immoral act. Among the various women-centric  \\nlaws in India, the most commonly invoked law is the anti-dowry law.  \\nWhat is Dowry?  \\nDowry, commonly known as ‘ dahej’ includes any gift that is not offered by the bride’s side on  \\ntheir own and anything that the groom’s side asks for, directly or indirectly. The groom’s side  \\nmust compel the bride’s side to fulfill their demands. If the groom’s side makes any demand  \\nas a precondition to marriage, without which the bride’s side anticipates that the marriage  \\nmight be called off, then also such demand will be considered as dowry.  \\nIt must be proved that a dowry demand  was made by the groom or his family which  \\ninvolves a direct/indirect deal with the family of the bride, to consider it as dowry. Dowry  \\ndemand can be made in form of cash, property or any other favours either before, during or  \\nafter the marriage.  \\nIt must be noted that dowry is different from Streedhan. Anything gifted by the bride’s  \\nparents to her and not to the groom is the sole property of the bride and is called ‘ streedhan ’  \\n(the wife’s property). Streedhan can be given at any time and includes the property inherited  \\nby the bride. Also includes gifts received by the bride in cash or kind by her husband’s  \\nfamily. Husband and his family have no right to it. Streedhan is treated as the self-acquired  \\nproperty of the bride but is returned to the family in case of an unforeseen death of the  \\nbride.  \\nWhat is the Anti-Dowry Law in India?  \\nThe Dowry Prohibition Act  has been in place in India since 1961, but the practice of dowry  \\nwent on undeterred. When it is not demanded outright, it is implied that the bride’s family  \\nwill have to give ‘gifts’ and provide for a certain standard of living for the groom and his  \\nfamily.  \\nDowry is illegal in India under the anti-dowry law. Under the Dowry Prohibition Act, any act  \\nto take or give dowry is punishable in India. The punishment for violating the anti-dowry law  \\nis imprisonment for up to 5 years and fine of Rs. 15,000 or the value of dowry given,  \\nwhichever is more. Any woman who is a victim of dowry in India must talk to a dowry lawyer  \\nto take appropriate legal action against her husband or his family members.  \\nEven negotiations for the dowry for a lesser deal from the groom’s side when the bride’s  \\nside is unable to fulfill the actual demand/real deal’ and the act of making the bride’s family fulfill \\ndemands as compensation for marrying their daughter after the wedding are all  \\npunishable under the law.  \\nThe Indian Penal Code lays down the anti-dowry law with regards to dowry deaths,  \\nunder Section 304B  and cruelty or domestic violence for dowry demands, under Section  \\n498A. The IPC makes the crime non-bailable, which means that the accused husband or  \\nfamily member cannot get a bail once arrested by the police.  \\nHowever, the anti-dowry law is not violated in the following case:  \\n\\uf0b7 When the gift is given by the bride’s parents of their own choosing to the newly  \\nmarried couple without being pressured or asked.  \\n\\uf0b7 The list of such gifts is drawn up by the family lawyer along with the cost of gifts and  \\na declaration that they were given to the couple out of the parents’ own choice.  \\n\\uf0b7 The groom’s family has a copy of the list of gifts and they are given only for the  \\ncouple’s use.  \\nMisuse of Anti-Dowry Law  \\nMisuse of anti-dowry law to blackmail husband has become a common practice. The  \\nnumber of false 498A cases  or cases of misuse of anti-dowry laws has even made the  \\nSupreme Court of India to term it as ‘legal terrorism’. The biased nature of this law has  \\nenabled women to file a false case against their husbands for reasons such as:  \\n\\uf0b7 To get out of the marriage due to her inability to adjust to the new family.  \\n\\uf0b7 Blackmailing the husband to extort money.   \\n \\uf0b7 To implicate the husband in a false case and rekindle with a man she was previously  \\nassociated with or got into an extra-marital affair with.  \\nRight to Education Act  \\nThe Act is completely titled “the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory  \\nEducation Act” . It was passed by the Parliament in August 2009. When the  \\nAct came into force in 2010, India became one among 135 countries where  \\neducation is a fundamental right of every child.  \\n\\uf0b7 The 86th Constitutional Amendment (2002) inserted Article 21A in the Indian  \\nConstitution  which states:  \\n\\uf0b7 “The State shall provide free and compulsory education to all children  \\nof 6 to 14 years in such manner as the \""
