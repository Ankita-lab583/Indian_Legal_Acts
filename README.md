Hereâ€™s a concise summary of project:

Project Title: Closed-Domain Question-Answering System for Indian Legal Acts

Task:
Developed a PDF-based Closed-Domain Question-Answering (CDQA) system to help students easily retrieve information about Indian legal acts, such as the RTI (Right to Information), RTE (Right to Education), and the Anti-Dowry Act.

Methodology Used:
- Utilized LangChain framework and NLP techniques to create an effective question-answering system.
- Processed Indian legal acts from PDFs using **PyPDF2** and **OpenAI embeddings** for semantic search.
- Employed **FAISS** (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for vector storage and similarity-based document retrieval.
- Implemented a **retrieval-based QA** mechanism to retrieve relevant provisions based on user queries.

**Result:**
- The system accurately answers user queries by extracting relevant information from legal documents.
- Enhanced accessibility and understanding of complex legal provisions for educational purposes.
